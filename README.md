# DSA-Introduction
Code implementation of data structure and algorithm when learning firstly.

I have learned DSA one year ago, and learn again this year. The reposity is not the original version.

All codes come from *Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java*,
just with a few diffenrences. Because most codes are consistent with book,
I don't write any annotation.

I don't design classes structure and other features.
I don't write codes to test their correction neither, 
which means some hidden errors may exist.<br>
I want to fix my attention on core codes of main methods, 
so I skipped others to finish later.

I implement these data structure : list, queue, deque, stack, 
tree, hashtable, priority queue and disjoint set.<br>
I also implement these algorithms : sorting, graph, 
greedy, divide-conquer, dynamic programming and back tracking.<br>
Furthermore, I give easy implementation of some DSA : 
red black tree, KMP, etc.
